This file exists so that `next dev` writes its agent-rules block here and not into CLAUDE.md
(node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js writes to AGENTS.md when it exists).
The block below is Next.js 16 text, kept verbatim, and scripts/scan-copy.mjs skips this file.
The rules for this repository are in CLAUDE.md.

<!-- BEGIN:nextjs-agent-rules -->

# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.
